# PBX13 project (not ready! Do not try to download it and use. WIP now.)

## Why the name is PBX13?

It is like Apollo. I have created many configurations of PBX for customers and two different web-based configuration sites. With Drupal (PHP-based CMS) and with Perl+jQuery. All my installations have the name PearlPBX.
And I like magic number 13 as I like the history of Apollo space ships. So be it. 

## What is it?

Django-based administration suite. The concept is different than older versions. It is like FreePBX but with Django.
You have a convenient instrument for administration PBX. You press the magic button 'Apply' and configured information transforms to Asterisk configuration files. And asterisk restarts after the event. 

## Prices and licences 
It is completely free to use. I did not use much time to create it. It is for fun. I love it. 

## Plans 
I plan to extend the project with commercial functions:
- docker and cloud compatibility 
- special agent to monitor and control Asterisk
- telemetry and logs panel using Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana bricks and shits
- alert management using Grafana and Slack integration 

- Callback hunter from the web interface using our service 
- Direct webrtc call to the customer support service. It is time to use WebRTC. Even iPhone can do it.
